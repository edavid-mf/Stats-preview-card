## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  object-fit: cover;
  filter: invert(36%) sepia(100%) saturate(170%) hue-rotate(234deg) brightness(65%) contrast(215%);
}
```

### Continued development

I still have to practice my abilities with flexbox, I'd like to start using Grid with Flexbox. I want to keep doing the Frontend-Masters projects.

### Useful resources
- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) - Thanks to this article I understood how to use the object-fit property, wich helps me to adjust the image aspect in relation to the container box.
- (https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/) - Thanks to this site I discovered the filter CSS property and understood how to use it and manipulate how an image is rendered in my page.
- (https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp)(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7415872/change-color-of-png-image-via-css) - These two helped me to apply my desired color to the image by using the filter property.

## Acknowledgments

Having a good management of CSS Flexbox will help you a lot! Be careful with the switch point between desktop and mobile layout so you are not breaking anything
